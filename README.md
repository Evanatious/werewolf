# Werewolf

## Rules
blah blah blah

The player with the most votes is executed. Each player with two or more votes and has a tie for most votes then both players are executed. If no player receives more than 1 vote, then no one is executed.
All executed players reveal their cards.

After one night and one day:
Villagers win the game if at least one werewolf dies; it doesn’t matter if an innocent(s) was (were) executed as well.
Villagers win the game if no one is executed and no werewolves are in the game.
Villagers can lose the game if they execute another villager (including the tanner) without catching any werewolves.

Werewolves win the game if at least one player is the werewolf and no werewolves are killed and the tanner isn’t killed.

Tanner is on neither villager nor werewolf team but (always) win the game if they manage to get themselves killed. If the tanner dies and no werewolves die, yet are in the game, then the werewolves lose. The villagers still win if the tanner dies, but also a werewolf dies. If only the tanner dies then only the tanner wins.
